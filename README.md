### Hello, world 👋

This is Danny Ramirez speaking. I'm 36 years old and I'm a Data Engineer 💻, I love handling, cleaning, and wrangling large volumes of data 📊. My weapon of choice is Python 🪱 since it lets you do pretty much everything. Other tools I'm experienced in:

- SQL 📅
- PowerBI 📈
- Hadoop 🐘
- Hive 🐝
- Spark ✨
- Airflow 💨

I recently finished a Data Science Bootcamp with @soyHenry, and I'm looking for the opportunity to kickstart my new career. I'm eager to keep learning, growing, and developing as the best data engineer I can be.

I also love cycling 🚵, coffee ☕️, and being ourdoors ⛺️.

Any questions? Drop me a line:
